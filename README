# auto-pbs

README file for "PBS auto-submission" scripts for use on Fermilab clusters.

This package contains two scripts:

wjay_multirep_auto_PBS.sh ("the PBS script")
launch_auto_PBS.sh ("the launch script")

Quick guide to modifications necessary to get the script up and running for your job.
Action points follow the "TODO" tags below.

All of these parameters should have self-evident names and will obviously change
with each new project.

TODO : Update your physics parameters in the PBS script.
TODO : Update run_traj to be the number of trajectories you want to run in a
    single submission of the PBS script. In general, the number will depend on
    the walltime requested in the PBS directives.
TODO : Update traj_limit to the final trajectory you ultimately want the whole
    stream to generate.

The autosubmission script assumes that the following directory structure exists.

rootstore : The "root" storage directory which contains all the long-term
            storage folders for gauge configurations and output files.

    rootstore/cfgstore : Storage folder for gauge configurations.
    rootstore/outstore : Storage folder for output files.
    rootstore/Misc     : Storage folder for "cooldown" and "delay_sub_list" files

The script does *not* automatically build this directory structrue. It is the
user's responsibility to make sure that the directory strucutre exists before
running the PBS autosubmission script.

The script tries to build the names for rootstore, cfgstore, and outstore using
the various physics paramters. Of course, the idea is that the user should choose
unique and sensible names.

The folder rootstore/Misc has a hard-coded name. Given a user-defined rootstore,
${rootstore}/Misc must exist. (Or the script will need modification.)

TODO : Construct the aforementioned directory structure.
TODO : Update variable names to agree with your choices for directory names.
TODO : Make certain you created the folder ${rootstore}/Misc.
TODO : Update variable names to agree with the executable, the executable's location,
    and the binary for "mpirun" (or whichever of its cousins you prefer).

#   Check the failsafe: if the failsafe file exists, stop immediately!  #
#                                                                       #

TODO : Look at, set, and write down or remember the directory where the script
    will search for the failsafe file.

TODO : Modify instances of "wjay" to be your username
TODO : If running someplace other than Fermilab, make sure that the long command
    following "qstat -l | ..." correctly looks for other jobs. Probably the most
    likely difference will is column placement in the qstat output, as reflected
    in the hard-coded numbers 3 and 5 in the awk command.

TODO : Modify the following line to give useful output in case of thrashing:
    echo "${PBS_O_WORKDIR}/wjay_multirep_auto_PBS.sh" >> ${delay_sub_file}

The PBS script automatically detects the last configuration and outputfiles
generated by the stream and starts up immediately after them. In order for this
automatic detection to work, the PBS script must know something about where the
trajectory number is stored.

My usage assumes that all output files and gauge configurations end with an
underscore followed by the trajectory number, i.e., *_${traj_number}.

In the case of different file naming conventions or delimiters, changes are
necessary.

TODO : As necessary, modify the regex processing to extract trajectory numbers.
